	<h1>The Magnificent <span> Desa Sarongan</span></h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			Desa Saronganâ€™s territory is surrounded by mountains and hills, such as Mount Beteng (222
			meters) and Mount Gendong (893) meters in the north. While in the south, this area is bordered
			by The Indian Ocean with a beautiful coastline. Some of its areas such as the stunning
			Rajegwesi Beach with its outstanding wild-life, Teluk Hijau, and Sukamade Beach are under the
			auspices of Meru Betiri National Park.
			<br />
			<br />
			Desa Sarongan has a quiet history back when the Indonesian government had not declared its independence
			yet. You can find a military base of the Dutch and Japanese here. Now, this military base is used
			by The Indonesian Navy at Rajegwesi beach, and the Indonesian Air Force post under The Air Force
			Operations Command II Abdul Rachman Saleh Air Base.
